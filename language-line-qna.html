<h1>Language Line - CSA Q&A</h1>
<h2>What is Language Line used for?</h2>
<p>Language Line is used to help with telephone calls with customers who need information in their own language. This is done via a three-way phone call.</p>
<h2>Do I need to arrange the conference call?</h2>
<p>No. Language Line arranges the conference call facilities at their end. You do not need to do this yourself.</p>
<h2>How do I set up a Language Line call?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Call Language Line: <strong>0845 3109900</strong></li>
<li>Quote Paradigmâ€™s ID code: <strong>700174</strong></li>
<li>Explain about your call to the operator.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What should I tell the operator?</h2>
<p>You should tell the operator whether the client is with you, or whether you need a dial-out. In a dial-out case, you stay on the line while the operator connects the translator and then the resident.</p>
